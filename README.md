The primary module of my second year was a team based project focused on producing an artifact based on one of several given titles. 

The title for the project was a game that learns which led to the group deciding on a tower defenence style game where the enemies sent would react ot the towers the player had placed however due to a break down of communication during the project the games potential wasnt fully realisedT he sections of the game I was responsible for was the UI design and implamentation as well as multiple aspects of the games core functionality such as thw towers. 

Module grade: 50
